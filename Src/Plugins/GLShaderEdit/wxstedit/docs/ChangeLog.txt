Changelog:

04/16/2006
    Add autocompletion for any word in the document in addition to the keywords
    Fix compilation for DLL lib, wxSTC doesn't export Scintilla's SString class

04/13/2006
    Don't allow loading the same file twice from disk in the notebook.
    Don't popup the save file as dialog unless they haven't previously
       loaded or saved the file to disk.

04/05/2006
    Fixed loaded/saving files when compiled in unicode. (Thanks Troels K)
    Removed old classname typedefs
    STE_BOOKMARK_MARKER -> STE_MARKER_BOOKMARK for consistency
    Added ID_STE_COPY_PRIMARY to copy to primary selection in unix systems
    Added ID_STE_PASTE_RECT to paste rectangular selections
    Removed old wxStyledTextCtrl_LoadFile, using streams now
    Fix find/replace in notebook not switching pages sometimes

11/20/05
    Moved the static functions for prepending strings to wxArrayString and
        wxComboBox out of classes as standalone functions, wxSTEPrependXXX.
    Allow only showing the styles used for any particular language in pref dlg.

10/30/05
    Finally renamed the classes from StyledTextEditorXXX to wxSTEditXXX.
    A simple find and replace should suffice.
    If you want to avoid doing the rename now you can pass
        STE_USE_OLD_CLASSNAMES=1 into your Makefile.

09/01/05
    Added preliminary autocompletion code
    Allow customizing the find/replace as wxWidgets does

08/24/05
    Fixed memory leak with refed documents
    Added splitter buttons above and to the side of the scrollbars for the
      StyledTextSplitter, optional.
    Test the width of the visible text and adjust scrollbars when user scrolls
      all the way to the right if the text won't be shown.
    Regex now works in the find/replace dialog and all find/replace functions.
    Changed FindAllStrings to return # found and you can pass in wxArrayInts
      to get the start and end positions.

08/21/05
    Changed the Save/LoadConfig for the different classes that have it to take
      only one path. The paths are now stored in the StyledTextEditorOptions,
      which you can change there.
    Added bool StyledTextEditor::LoadInputStream (from Troels Knakkergaard)
      to load from an inputstream and if the file is unicode, ask if it should
      be loaded that way or just raw ascii.

08/15/05
    Redid the language pref dialog page
    Added user set file patterns, styles, additional keywords
    Added pref to enable/disable dclick adding bookmark
    Use size_t for all items indexing into arrays and array sizes

08/13/05
    * Printing now fully works in MSW. (Thanks to Deepak)
    Added option to print linenumbers or not.
    Fixed some of the menu item accelerators to match typical programs
    Removed redundant tooltips that don't explain anymore than the static text.
    Fixed config saving for markers and indicators
    Added ability to remove styles

08/11/05
    * Changed colours from BBGGRR to RRGGBB, use old method by setting in
        stestyls.h #define STE_COLOURS_BBGGRR 1
    * Changed FindString to take start_pos and end_pos so that you can find
        within a range. (eventually find in selection will be added)
    Changed StyledTextEditorPrefs::Get/SetPref to return/take wxStrings
       use Get/SetPrefInt for int values.
    Use wxHTMLEasyPrinting for printing now... at least for now.
    Cleanup for Find code.

08/01/05
    Added columnize function, dialog, and menu item
    Styles in config are found by name not number
    Styles are mapped do that you can have 10000 generic styles
    STE_STYLE_TEXT is now STE_STYLE_DEFAULT
    Added TranslatePos/Lines to aid in calculating valid input to functions
    STEMenuManager uses separate masks for each File, Edit, etc menu
    Quit on frame now called Exit like everyone else
    Added event for double click on margin

07/20/05
    Rewrote the languages adding the rest of the words, updated to scite 1.64

06/05/05
    Redid the prefs dialog by making them more modular and complete. The main
    prefs page is now split up into a few separate pages.

    Updated the language dialog to show the styles used in an editor instead
    of using a listbox. I think this makes this much clearer.

    Fixed a bug in the frame's splitter where the wrong window would get hidden.

03/30/05
    Lots of little changes, broke the files into a single file per class.
    Fixed some minor find/replace bugs
    Fixed notebook sort flickering when two pages have the same name
    Added InsertText dialog to easily prepend, append, insert at col, and
    surround the selection with text.

    Updated the Languages to wxWidgets 2.5.4 so you may have to copy
    include/stedit/setup0.h to setup.h. Excluding different languages is still
    unused though and I'm starting to think that the way to go is to write an
    XML file rather than hardcoding it in C.

    Rename StyledTextFrame/Notebook::GetSplitter to GetEditorSplitter
    Rename StyledTextFrame::GetNotebook to GetEditorNotebook

    Move enum StyledTextEditor::marginNumber/Marker/Fold to
        enum STE_MARGIN_NUMBER/MARKER/FOLD
    Move enum StyledTextEditor::bookmarkMarker to
        enum STE_BOOKMARK_MARKER

07/25/04
    Put all the popup menus for the notebook, splitter, and editor into the
    StyledTextEditorOptions. A big change, but now anyone can update the
    state of the menus through the options. There was also probably not much
    sense having each editor sharing the same options create their own popup,
    so this'll cut down on mem usage and speed up editor creation a bit.

    Removed all CreatePopupMenu functions for the editor, splitter, notebook
    since all they did was call the StyledTextEditorMenuManager code.

    Removed all the UpdateMenu/Tool functions in favor of a single UpdateItems
    and UpdateAllItems, where UpdateItems takes menu, menubar, toolbar
    (any can be NULL) and UpdateAllItems automatically updates everything.

    Removed the temporary StyledTextEditorMenuOptions to make the
    StyledTextEditorMenuManager store the three ints of what menus to create.

    Removed some of the prefs bloat by initializing the default values using
    member functions. Use const char and not wxChar for the lexer words since
    even in Unicode we don't want to translate them nor will they be multibyte.

    The Shutdown() function that stopped sending the StyledTextEditorEvents is
    now called SendSTEEvents(bool send) so you can turn them on or off. It
    still serves the same purpose of allowing you to not propagate a focus event
    just before being deleted and crashing, but has a more descriptive name.

07/22/04
    Removed StyledTextEditorNumberDialog, using the wxNumberEntryDialog instead
    for both 2.4.x and >= 2.5.x. In 2.4.x the wxNumberEntryDialog is
    private in src/generic/numdlgg.cpp it's declaration is copied in stedit.cpp.

03/22/04
    Added StyledTextEditorFindReplaceData::Load/SaveConfig, for flags.

    Added prefs/styles/langs into the StyledTextEditorOptions so that
    it's simplier to create exactly what you want and have it passed to
    children. Got rid of STE_USE_GLOBAL_PREFS/STYLES/LANGS since they're
    passed through the options now.

    Added StyledTextMenuManager into the options and made virtual functions
    for creating all the menus for the different windows. Again, this is
    far more flexible and you can subclass the menu manager and use your
    own for complete control.

    Removed the delayed update event since the problem was in the Scintilla
    drawing code and not the updateui code.

    Added popupmenu, menubar, toolbar methods to the notebook so that it now
    updates them on the fly. Before the frame struggled to do it for you.

    Redid the menubar and toolbar creation for the frame since it now uses the
    menumanager from the options (if any).

    Fixed assorted find/replace bugs, better check to see if we really can't
    find or replace.

03/20/04
    Removed the StyledTextEditorOptions from the constructor for the
    StyledTextFrame. You must create a frame in two steps now.
    StyledTextFrame *f = new StyledTextFrame(....); f->CreateOptions(options);
    I didn't realize how sensitive MSVS was to calling virtual functions
    in the constructor or even from an event from the constructor. GCC doesn't
    seem to care.
    Removed EVT_STF_CREATED since it's useless in light of the above.

    Changed the StyledTextEditorOptions to be ref counted and also contain the
    default filename/path/extensions. I want to create editors that will load
    different file types etc so the previous static method didn't cut it. The
    options are ref counted so that all items sharing the options are updated.

    Fixed severe find/replace bug, why didn't it show up in GTK?

    Added code for menus item creation in menu manager for the frame's menubar.

    Added notebook option for allowing no pages. It's really a lot of work to
    disable all the appropriate menu items, but you can do it if you want.

03/19/04
    Fix bug in wxSTC file loading for unicode. Should be fixed in wxWidgets CVS
    soon enough, but must wait until 2.4.3. Using internal
    wxStyledTextCtrl_LoadFile for now.

    Renamed CopyForRefedEditor to just RefEditor since that's what it does. It
    also now calls AddRefDocument & SetDocPointer for you, it should have been
    that way before. To ref another editor, just call editor->RefEditor(other).

    Got rid of using EVT_WINDOW_CREATE to send EVT_ST(X)_CREATED since in MSW
    it comes way too early, it worked well in GTK though.

    MSVS project file update for 2.4 and 2.5.

    Save last opened dir in wxConfig, print the location of the config file in
    the About dialog if wxConfigBase::Get(FALSE) is a wxFileConfig.

    *** Bug FIX ***
    There is a bug in scintilla that can be duplicated in SciTE when you have
    SC_CACHE_PAGE set, the default SC_CACHE_CARET does not lead to that error.
    Maybe the whole UpdateUI stuff was just a wild goose chase? Though maybe it
    does make sense to not try to hilight the brackets during an OnPaint.
    see StyledTextEditor::Create for the valgrind output.
    ***

03/13/04
    Made a single wxEVT_STE_STATE_CHANGED event and added StyledTextEditorEvent.
    This replaces all the EVT_STE_CANCOPY... events. It uses an enum
    STE_StateType to really simplify the whole updating mechanism. The event
    also has a HasStateChanged and GetStateValue functions to make this a much
    nicer way than all the different events. The event contains the whole state
    as a single int.

    The StyledTextEditorPrefs/Styles/Langs are now used as fully ref counted
    objects. Previously they were pointers in StyledTextEditor so that if they
    were NULL it meant don't use. Now, if they're !Ok() then don't use. You
    treat them exactly like a wxBitmap for example. Added
    NullStyledTextEditorPrefs/Styles/Langs to use like wxNullBitmap.

    Moved the lettercase into the font styles for StyledTextEditorStyles. Makes
    parsing the style line a little faster since it's smaller.

    Moved the creation code back into the Create function and out of the
    EVT_SCX_CREATED event handler. This was doing strange things occasionally
    and so some of the functions had to become non virtual.

    Bug Fixes:

    *** Not really sure of this? ***
    Fixed crashing in GTK from Scintilla sending an UpdateUI event in the
    middle of a wxPaintEvent. Used to do DoBraceMatch then, but we were already
    painting and then Scintilla would try to delete an invalid text renderer
    element. Uses a delayed event system where AddPendingEvent is used to send a
    fake EVT_BUTTON until we're finally out of OnPaint. Only then call
    DoBraceMatch and check if the state (CanCut...) has changed and send event.

    *** wxstedit program ***
    If you used an earlier version you will get an error for loading the
    preferences at startup since the format has changed.
    You may answer Yes to fix the preferences or just delete the preference
    file called wxStEdit.ini in MSW or ~/.wxStEdit in *nix.

    -Cleanup, more docs in the headers.
    -All the Find/Replace buttons really work now, removed "Find All" added
     seach in all docs for notebook.
    -StyledTextEditorPrefs saves values as int even if the option is basicly
     a bool, for example WRAPMODE has only two states wxSTC_WRAP_NONE and
     wxSTC_WRAP_WORD. If the wxSTC function takes a bool the pref is bool,
     else int.
    -Added pref for showing marker margin, but no gui element to show it.
    -The styles are stored in a wxArrayString, should be a little smaller than
     the hashmap and speed shouldn't be a problem.
    -Added styles for indicators and some functions to easily add them.
    -All data used with the StyledTextEditor is in the ref counted
     StyledTextEditorData so that refing editors really do share the same data.
    -Removed all static variables from the header, use static members of
     StyledTextEditor to get them
    -Added StyledTextEditorOptions class to hold the options for the
     frame, notebook, splitter, editor, and menus
    -Added StyledTextEditorMenuManager to create all the menus. Makes the
     editor class quite a lot smaller and easier to look through.
    -Preference dialog uses pages of StyledTextEditorPrefDialogPageBase to
     make the dialog class smaller since it only calls two virtual functions.
    -Added Print options dialog and removed print magnification dialog.

    Bug Fixes:

    -Removed Menu item Edit->Clear with DEL key accelerator. MSW stole the key
     and though this could simply be implemented, but there's not much point in
     having a "Clear" item since everyone knows what DEL will do.
    -Print preview correctly displays with any scaling
    -Show dialog to "Save File As" if filename isn't valid or if the file wasn't
     loaded from disk in the first place.

    Initial release.
