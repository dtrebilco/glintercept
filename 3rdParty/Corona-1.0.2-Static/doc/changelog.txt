- fixed memory leaks in SavePNG (Hosam Abdulrrazek)
- you can now specify an initial pixel buffer as the fourth argument
  to CreateImage (Hosam Abdulrrazek)

  found

  pixel formats

  properly support flipped and mirrored images.
- added Kevin Gadd's change to make SaveImage() for PNG images save
  the correct pixel format, including the palette.
- added GetSupportedReadFormats and GetSupportedWriteFormats for
  supported format enumeration

2002.08.01
