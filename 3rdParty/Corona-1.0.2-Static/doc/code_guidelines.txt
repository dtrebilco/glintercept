Corona Coding Guidelines:

Syntax:
  - Keep lines under eighty characters.

  - Pretty straightforward...  just try to write clear code and
    follow the rest of the library's style.

Semantics:
  - When you write or read data to or from a file, don't read one byte
    at a time.  Read as large of a buffer as you can, and then process
    the data in memory.  Remember:  Each read operation is a virtual
    function *and* a system call.

  - Write your code to be independent of endianness.  For example,
    don't write something like the following code.

    struct header {
      int size;
      int width;
      int height;
      ...
    };

    header h;
    file->read(&h, sizeof(h));

    This code will only work if sizeof(int) is whatever the size of
    the value in the actual header on disk is.  Also, it will only
    work if the int is packed in the same endianness as the host
    platform.  It is much safer to read a fixed-size array of bytes
    and manually (explicitly, if you will) unpack the members.  For
    example...

    typedef unsigned char byte;

    // read 16-bit little-endian
    inline int read16(byte* c) {
      return c[0] + (c[1] << 8);
    }

    // read 32-bit little-endian
    inline int read32(byte* c) {
      return read16(c) + (read16(c + 2) << 16);
    } 

    byte header[256];
    file->read(header, 256);
    int size   = read32(header);
    int width  = read32(header + 4);
    int height = read32(header + 8);
