-- Where'd the name come from? --

My friend Ben came over and said "You should name something Corona."
So I did.


-- Why another image library?  We already have DevIL, FreeImage,
   etc... --

I simply wasn't satisifed with the others.  They either had complex
APIs, weren't portable, didn't support the functionality I wanted, or
weren't deployed well (i.e. no nice Win32 distribution and GNU
autoconf/automake install).  Also, Corona was a direct outgrowth of
Sphere's image loading/saving functionality.  Corona gave me a chance
to rewrite it, making it clearer, faster, and safer.  At the same
time, Sphere's binary code size shrunk.

Corona only took about a week's worth of work to create.  The bulk of
the code was written in two late nights, and the rest has been
cleaning things up, writing documentation, and testing the decoders.

This library is designed for use within several of my personal
projects (Sphere, PictureShow, Naikai, Battlements) and the ISU Game
Developers Club (http://isugamedev.sf.net/).


-- Corona loads my image upside down! --

There's a good chance it doesn't.  Corona follows the convention that
the first row of pixels in the array it gives you is the top row.
Other graphics packages expect rows from the bottom up.  If your image
appears upside-down, try using the recently-added FlipImage() function
provided by Corona.

A similar problem is that discreet's 3ds max outputs texture (uv)
coordinates upside down with respect to how OpenGL expects them.
There are two common solutions to this problem.  You can flip the
images when loading them or modify the texture coordinates so that
v' = 1 - v.
